``pyramid_who`` Changelog
=========================

Unreleased
----------

- Added a "challenge decider" function for use by ``repoze.who`` with
  current versions of ``pyramid``, which now return "403 Forbidden" instead
  of "401 Unauthorized" on authorization failures.

- Add tox.ini for Jenkins testing.

- ZCML directive no longer compatible with Pyramid 1.0, 1.1, 1.2.  Only 1.3
  supported.  Also requires pyramid_zcml 0.9.2 or better.

0.2 (2011-03-23)
----------------

- Pass the identifier plugin to ``api.remember``, rather than its name,
  as required by the interface.  Fixes

- Fixed test of ``unauthenticated_userid``.

- Fixed tests broken by ``repoze.who`` changes (relaxing exceptions to
  warnings for missing / invalid config rile).
